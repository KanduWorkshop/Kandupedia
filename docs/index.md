## Welcome

Welcome to this new location for infomation relating to Model railroading. 

The information in this site is based and directed towards Australian railways. 

Lets make thie information here as accurate and comprehensive as possible, but i cannot do this alone, any help is appreciated. 

This is only a part time project, it will take time to get this all set up and laid out in a way that works, and there will be a lot of trial and error. 

The plan is to provide information of prototypes to help modellers make accurate models, and there will be section that include modelling tips and tricks to help with many facets of this wonderful hobby.
